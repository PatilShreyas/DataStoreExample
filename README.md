# DataStore Example - Android

### Read [this](https://medium.com/scalereal/hello-datastore-bye-sharedpreferences-android-f46c610b81d5) article to get details about implementation.

## What is DataStore 🤷‍♀️?
Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution. It allows us to store key-value pairs (like SharedPreferences) or typed objects with protocol buffers.
DataStore uses Kotlin and Coroutines + Flow to store data synchronously with consistency and transaction support 😍. In short, it's the new data storage solution which is the replacement of SharedPreferences.
